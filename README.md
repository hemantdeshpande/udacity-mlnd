machine learning class projects    
1) Boston Housing: Regression Modelling to Predict Housing Prices: Applied DecisionTree Based regressor, used gird-search to optimize and cross-validation to fit the model.        
2) Finding Donors: Data Classification to Predict a potential donor from basic statisitcs: Compared various classifiers - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree based AdaBoost/Bagging/RandomForest/GradientTreeBoost classifiers. Optimized the best model gradient tree boosting with GridSearch.      
3) Customer Segments: Data clustering to identify customer segments. Pre-processed data for un-skewing/normalizing and identifying outliers. Applied PCA for dimension reduction and used Gaussian Mixture Model and K-Means clustering to predict customer segments.    
4) Smartcab: Used reinforcement learning (epsilon-Greedy exploration base Q-learning), to train a cab to learn traffic rules.
